Great choice! A **mini SQL project** is a perfect way to learn and showcase your skills. Here's a beginner-friendly project idea you can build with SQL only (or with a bit of front-end if you want to expand it later).

---

## 🟦 Mini SQL Project: **Student Management System**

### 🔹 Goal:

Create and manage a small database for a school/college that tracks students, their courses, and grades.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Plan

### 📌 1. **Create the Database**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE StudentDB;
USE StudentDB;
```

---

### 📌 2. **Create Tables**

#### 🧑 Students Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    age INT
);
```

#### 📚 Courses Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Courses (
    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    course_name VARCHAR(100),
    instructor VARCHAR(100)
);
```

#### 📝 Enrollments Table (Many-to-Many)

```sql
CREATE TABLE Enrollments (
    enrollment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    grade CHAR(2),
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES Students(student_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES Courses(course_id)
);
```

---

### 📌 3. **Insert Sample Data**

```sql
-- Students
INSERT INTO Students VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'alice@mail.com', 20);
INSERT INTO Students VALUES (2, 'Bob', 'bob@mail.com', 21);

-- Courses
INSERT INTO Courses VALUES (101, 'Database Systems', 'Dr. Smith');
INSERT INTO Courses VALUES (102, 'Web Development', 'Ms. Lee');

-- Enrollments
INSERT INTO Enrollments VALUES (1, 1, 101, 'A');
INSERT INTO Enrollments VALUES (2, 1, 102, 'B');
INSERT INTO Enrollments VALUES (3, 2, 101, 'A');
```

---

### 📌 4. **Write Useful Queries**

#### 🔍 Get all students:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Students;
```

#### 📘 List courses a student is enrolled in:

```sql
SELECT s.name, c.course_name
FROM Students s
JOIN Enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
JOIN Courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id;
```

#### 🏆 Find students with grade A:

```sql
SELECT s.name, c.course_name, e.grade
FROM Enrollments e
JOIN Students s ON e.student_id = s.student_id
JOIN Courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
WHERE grade = 'A';
```

---

## 🌟 Bonus Features (If You Want to Expand)

* Add **teacher table** with office hours
* Add **attendance tracking**
* Add **project submissions**
* Create a **simple frontend** with PHP, Python (Flask), or Node.js

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn:

* Table creation and relationships (1-to-many, many-to-many)
* SQL queries: `JOIN`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`
* Data normalization and foreign keys
* Real-world database structure

---

Would you like:

* A **ready SQL file** with this code?
* To turn this into a **web project**?
* A different theme (e.g., library system, online store)?
